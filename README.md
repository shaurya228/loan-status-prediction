Loan Approval Prediction Model
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not. The model utilizes various applicant background information, such as gender, marital status, income, and education, to make its predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains 13 features that may influence loan approval decisions. Some of these features include:

Gender: The applicant's gender.
Married: Whether the applicant is married or not.
Dependents: The number of dependents the applicant has.
Education: The applicant's education level.
Self_Employed: Whether the applicant is self-employed or not.
ApplicantIncome: The applicant's income.
Machine Learning Lifecycle
The project follows the standard machine learning lifecycle:

Data Collection: Gather relevant data, including historical loan data, customer information, credit scores, and employment history.
Data Cleaning: Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Feature Impact
The README briefly discusses how each feature might impact the loan approval decision. For example, married individuals might be perceived as more financially stable, and higher income generally indicates a better ability to repay the loan.

Next Steps
The project is currently in its early stages. The next steps would involve:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain deeper insights into the data distribution, relationships between features, and potential patterns.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's predictive power.
Model Selection and Training: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms and train them on the prepared data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Model Deployment: Deploy the model into a production environment for real-world use.
